# PublicProjects
This is mostly random small projects work, basic ideas and proofs of concept. This is not a repository for an ongoing project.
Most code is written by me, although some is based on online guidance. No warranty or obligation any of the code is up to date or working.
Feel free to email me at arthurvai34@gmail.com for any questions.
